Curriculum: Ana Belén Bergese
I am from Argentina, and I live in Barcelona since 5 years.

FULLSTACK WEB DEVELOPER						
I consider myself a motivated-happy person with a desire to learn and grow professionally. I am a very friendly person and I am looking for a fast-paced work environment. I am excited to be part of your team and contribute with my technical skills, soft skills, and my willingness to learn and develop.
Over the past 3 years, I have dedicated myself wholeheartedly to the study and development of software. I discovered a subject that truly impassions me, and I consider myself very fortunate for it.
I take pleasure in working independently, tackling complex problems on my own, and have created several apps autonomously. Through this, I have honed my own work methodology and problem-solving approach. However, this doesn't mean I don't enjoy working in a team; quite the opposite, I highly value it and believe that effective intra-team communication and collaboration with other teams are crucial.
